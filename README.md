# NBA Score Analyzer
A full stack application based on python and mongodb to scrape game data from [https://stats.nba.com/](https://stats.nba.com/) and build a continuous predictor.

## Development Setup

First, clone repo if you haven't already and navigate into project directory e.g. Documents/nba_score_analyzer:

  ```bash
  $ cd Documents/nba_score_analyzer
  ```
  
Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```bash
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```
  
Install requirements:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the scripts
### Scrape game data and store it in MongoDB:

Either run script with one argument to scrape a specific date:
  ```python
  python3 nba_scraper.py 02/27/2020
  ```

Or run script with two arguments to scrape games that fall in a specific interval:
  ```python
  python3 nba_scraper.py 02/12/2020 02/27/2020
  ```

The scraper will then access the endpoint and scrape the response with the formatting pictured below and store the json in as a document in the MongoDB database.

### Predictor Notebook:
As of now everything concerning the prediction is located in the notebook called predictor.ipynb. The goal is to predict the winner of a future game given the features derived from past games. Therefore, I have fitted the following classifier:

- XGBClassifier
- SVC
- Logistic Regression
